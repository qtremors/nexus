## ‚ú® Core Features

* **Interactive Navigation**: A central space station that summons animated "spaceship" links (to my Portfolio, GitHub, etc.).
* **Advanced Animations**: Fluid and complex UI animations powered by **Framer Motion**, featuring sequenced enter/exit transitions for a polished user experience.
* **Multi-Layered Background**: A deep and immersive background created with:
    * An interactive starfield generated by **`tsparticles`** that reacts to mouse movement.
    * A looping video of a central black hole.
    * The blackhole eats the stars with the help of **`destroyer`** slowly as time passes.
    * A distant planet's surface.
* **Ambient Animation**: A Voyager space probe continuously traverses the screen using pure CSS `offset-path` animation, with a tooltip visible on hover.
* **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript for a robust and performant application.
* **Scoped Styling**: Utilizes CSS Modules for clean, component-scoped styling that avoids global namespace conflicts.
