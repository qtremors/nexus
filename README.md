# üöÄ Interactive Space Website

This project is a creative landing page built with Next.js, designed to showcase my profile and projects in an engaging, cosmic environment. Navigate through my digital universe by deploying a fleet of spaceships from the central command station. A portal takes to the `Projects` page showing all my projects status.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### üåå Interactive Hero Page
- A **central space station** that summons animated "spaceship" links (Portfolio, GitHub, Contact, etc.).
- Smooth, sequenced enter/exit animations powered by **Framer Motion**.
- **Multi-layered background**:
  - Interactive starfield generated by **tsparticles** that reacts to mouse movement.
  - Looping background video of a **black hole** at the center.
  - A particle **absorber/destroyer** that slowly consumes stars as time passes.
  - A distant planet surface image for depth.
- **Ambient animation**: A Voyager-style probe continuously traverses the screen via CSS `offset-path`, with a hover tooltip.

### üõ∞Ô∏è Project Management Dashboard
- **Full CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for Projects.
- **Recycle Bin**: soft-delete and restore projects.
- **Project Progress Tracker**: stages such as `init ‚Üí push ‚Üí deploy`.
- **Server-side logic** implemented with **Next.js Server Actions**‚Äîno traditional API endpoints required.

### üé® Styling & Animations
